# Welcome to our Garage.

This is where we keep our upcoming, incomplete, and ongoing projects out of the rain while the paint dries.  We're pretty open with what we're doing, so feel free to keep an eye on what we're project we working on while the hood's still up.

## Project Gallery

The gallery will constantly be updated with various items we're working on.  We throw up comps, betas, and various deigns from just about any stage of development.

## Project 2Lane

Project 2Lane is a brand new project that is currently in the alpha stages of production.  We're keeping our lips tight because we think this ones gonna be really awesome.  I can say it has something to do with tuning GMC Syclones, Typhoons, and maybe more cars.   Right now we have a small group of privileged testers that are helping us shape the future of Revolution Industries.
