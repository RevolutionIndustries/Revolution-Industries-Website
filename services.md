# Web
## Web Sites
We make sites from scratch, overhaul existing sites, even help with maintaining your site.

## The Best Practices

We understand doc types, alt tags, progressive enhancement, validation, and all sorts of nerdy things you shouldn't have to care about.  But the truth is, under the hood everything needs to be interoperable and proven.  We strive to have everything we work on not only validate, but structurally make sense and be accessible.  After all, what good is a lambo scissor door if your just going to hit your head on it every time you jump in for a ride.

## Graphic Design

We're talking a combined 40+ years of experience.  From layout &amp; user interface design to pure rockstar photoshop skills, we can put together something to wow you and keep your users happy.

## Galleries, Shopping Carts &amp; Blogs

We've had intimate, up close experience with the underside of many of the open source projects like Drupal, Joomla, MODx, Gallery, Wordpress, Zen Cart, OSCommerce, &amp; more.  We've installed, managed, and built mods for just about anything you're going to want to use.

## Flash &amp; Flex

Our team is very versed in the development of Flash and Flex applications, starting at the most basic animations and scaling to full blown apps, we can build it well.  We have a experience going back to Flash 5, a Certified Flash Developer, and countless hours buried in ActionScript 2 &amp; 3.

# Print

We have experience in digital pre-press that includes offset printing, flexography, screen print and even color correction. We know the lingo and can make your ideas not only work on the monitor, but jump off the paper too.

## Print Some:

* *Business Cards* - Full color, 2 sided, die cuts, spot UV.  Basically, some kick-ass cards.
* *Flyers* - There is nothing like a 2 sided glossy flyer with your name on it.
* *Posters* - Cause having a bad-ass poster can mean taking home that trophy at the next car show.
* *More*

# Applications &amp; Programming

We love digging through code in the same way we love rummaging through the box of performance parts.  There is a lot to know, and we've got quite a bit of experience building solid, commented, reusable code.  We're talking stuff like JavaScript, ActionScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, &amp; Objective C.  We're not mindless kids working summer jobs at Quick Stop Oil &amp; Lube: we do this stuff cause we love it.  That's exactly what we look for in an automotive paint shop, and that what you should be looking for in a programmer.

## Build Apps like:

* *Rich Internet Apps* - Back ends, front ends, &amp; middle ware.  We build it strong, fast, and good looking.
* *iPhone Apps* - It's a big craze for a reason, iPhone apps are pretty damn cool!
* *Adobe AIR Desktop Apps* - Build desktop apps that can easily connect to your internet systems. 
* *More*
